			This is such a big tournament in Europe that the process to get tickets is not easy. There are multiple phases for purchasing tickets however, each is a lottery. According to theathletic.com, &quot;the first phase has already concluded with over 1.2 million in ticket sales&quot;. The second phase will open on December 2, 2023 to supporters who are from any of the 21 nation participating in the tournament. To participate in the second phase lottery, for authentication reasons, supporters must apply for tickets via the national association of their nation. There are a couple other phases to receiving a ticket for this once in a lifetime event. The last phase involves the UEFA creating a platform for tickets to be resold. This opens in the spring of 2024 to help prevent ticket resale fraud.
