			<h2> 
				The History of the European Championship
			</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p class="indent-20">
				The official beginning of the European Championship is subjective. The first ever tournament was held in 1960, however the concept was created much earlier. It started in 1927 with the French Football Federation administrator, Henri Delaunay, who proposed an all-European football tournament. The trophy for this tournament is called the Henri Delaunay trophy, named after the tournament’s creator. With the Soviet Union being the  first winner in 1960, every year the winners are engrained on the trophy. According to footballhistory.com, &quot;the two most successful nations in tournament history have been Germany and Spain&quot;.
